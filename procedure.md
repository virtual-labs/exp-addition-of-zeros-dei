### Procedure for the experiment is as follows:

<p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>5.1. User Inputs:</strong></p>
                 <p style="margin-left:20px;">5.1.1. Firstly, adjust the value of the coefficient c of a numerator polynomial by sliding the slider.<br>
                 5.1.2. Now adjust the value of coefficients p, q and r of a denominator polynomial by sliding the other slider.<br>
                 5.1.3. Enter the location of zeros Z1 and Z2 by scrolling up or down. <br>
                 5.1.4. Click on the “Add Zero” button to add the selected location of zeros and  “Delete Zero” button to delete the selected location of zeros.<br>
                 5.1.5. Press “Submit” button to submit the values of coefficients of numerator and 
                            denominator polynomial and location of zeros selected.</p>

<p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>5.2. Calculations:</strong></p>
                <p style="margin-left:20px;">5.2.1. Click on the  “Run” button to obtain the input transfer function equation.<br>
                5.2.2. Click on  “Run” button again to obtain the transfer function with 0 zero.<br>
                5.2.3. Again, click on  “Run”  button to get the transfer function with 1 zero.<br>
                5.2.4. Once more click on  “Run”  button to get the transfer function with 2 zeros.<br>
                5.2.5. Again, click on  “Run”  button to get the time domain equation of step response for selected number of zeros in calculation window.</p>
<p style="margin-left:0px;"><strong>5.3 Results:</strong></p>
                <p style="margin-left:20px;">5.3.1. Once more click on the  “Run”  button to obtain the step response plot for the addition of zeros to the forward path transfer function of a closed loop system in s-plane in the result section and conclusion in the conclusions section (bottom).</p>
